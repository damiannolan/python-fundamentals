# Python Fundamentals

## Emerging Technologies - Problem Sheet 1

This respoitory contains a series of basic Python scripts. These are a few problems from around the internet that aim
to provide a better understanding of Python as a programming language. A link to the original problem sheet can be found
[here!](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/python-fundamentals.html)

This repository can also be treated as a Python basics tutorial for beginners looking to develop an interest in
programming.

## Prerequistes

Install Python 3 using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install python3
```
## Problems
 
**1. Hello World**

A basic "Hello World" program.

**2. Current Time**

Prints the current time and date to the console.

**3. FizzBuzz**

Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, except for the following conditions. For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of
the number, and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
“FizzBuzz”.

**4. Factorial Digit Sum**

Calculates the sum of the digits of the factorial of a number. n! means n x (n − 1) … x 3 x 2 x 1. For example, 10! = 10
x 9 x … x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27. Find the
sum of the digits in the number 100!

**5. Guessing Game**

Guessing game where the user must guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their
number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if
they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

**6. Largest and Smallest in List**

A function that returns the largest and smallest elements in a list.

**7. Palindrome Test**

A function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.

**8. Merge List and Sort**

A function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list. [1,4,6],[2,3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6].

**9. Newton's Method for Square Roots**

Implement the square root function using Newton’s method. In this case, Newton’s method is to approximate sqrt(x) by
picking a starting point z and then repeating:

```
z_next = z - ((z*z - x) / (2 * z))
```

**10. Reverse String**

A function that outputs the reverse of a string
